Vishrambh is a DApp that is built on blockchain systems and connected to the unique offering of IndiaStack consisting of Aadhaar, UPI, and digilocker; built and maintained by the Indian government. The users of the application are classified as donors, beneficiaries, NGO partners and 3rd party partners. The authentication of each of these users happens via Aadhaar and all payments done via the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) are recorded on the blockchain.

The donors donate the money while specificying constraints on how they would like such donations being used. These are encoded into a blockchain understandable smart contract and executed as required giving the full transparent trace of the donation as it reaches the intended beneficiaries.
