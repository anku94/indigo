<p>I work as a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research, Bangalore with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/saikat/">Saikat Guha</a> at the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/mobility-networks-and-systems/">Mobility, Networks, and Systems group</a>.</p>

<p>I broadly work in the area of Privacy & Security, helping Microsoft comply with European Union's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">General Data Protection Regulation</a>, which comes into force on 25<sup>th</sup> May, 2018.</p>

<p>In parallel, I am also working on a blockchain-based audit, accounting and compliance platform for organizations in the social sector.</p>

<p>I previously graduated with a Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering, from <a href="https://iiit.ac.in">IIIT Hyderabad</a>. I then spent one year working as a Software Developer with the <a href="https://flock.co">Flock</a> team at <a href="http://directi.com">Directi</a></p>

<p>My research interests lie in systems, specifically large-scale systems that handle and process massive amounts of data.</p>

<p>When I'm not coding, I spend my time exploring Bangalore on my <a href="http://speroelectric.in">e-bike</a>, reading up on finance, politics, and legislation, and retweeting <a href="https://twitter.com/dickkingsmith/status/930761200044036097?lang=en">cat videos</a> on <a href="https://twitter.com/schwifty50">Twitter</a></p>
