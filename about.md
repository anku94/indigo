<p>I am a PhD student at the <a href="http://www.pdl.cmu.edu/PEOPLE/ankush.shtml">Parallel Data Lab</a> at Carnegie Mellon University. I am advised by <a href="http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~gamvrosi/">Prof. George Amvrosiadis</a>. Currently I'm working on a framework to express high-throughput data pipelines (for example, <a href="https://lcls.slac.stanford.edu/overview">scientific computing pipelines</a>) over <a href="http://www.pdl.cmu.edu/DeltaFS/">DeltaFS</a>.

<p>Previously I worked as a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research, Bangalore with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/saikat/">Saikat Guha</a> at the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/mobility-networks-and-systems/">Mobility, Networks, and Systems group</a>. I broadly worked on building systems for GDPR compliance, and a blockchain-based audit platform for organizations in the social sector. </p>

<p>I graduated with a Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering, from <a href="https://iiit.ac.in">IIIT Hyderabad</a>. I then spent one year working as a Software Developer with the <a href="https://flock.co">Flock</a> team at <a href="http://directi.com">Directi</a></p>

<p>My research interests lie in systems, specifically large-scale systems that handle and process massive amounts of data.</p>

<p>When I'm not coding, I spend my time exploring Pittsburgh's beautiful <a href="/assets/images/point_state_park.jpg">trails</a> on my <a href="https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/motorbikes/202894-e-bikes-electric-bicycle-comprehensive-guide.html">e-bike</a>, reading up on finance, politics, and legislation, and retweeting <a href="https://twitter.com/dickkingsmith/status/930761200044036097?lang=en">cat videos</a> on <a href="https://twitter.com/schwifty50">Twitter</a>.</p>
